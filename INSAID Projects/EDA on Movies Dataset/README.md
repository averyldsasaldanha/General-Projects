This repository contains details about the analysis done on the Movies Dataset.  It contains steps on - What did I do, How did I evaluate the data points and used the same to come to logical conclusion.

This project was created as a part of INSAID's Term1/Term 2 module.  The dataset used was from the github repository where 1000 movie records were documented with 12 different variables to be analysed for a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2016.

In this project, we will evaluate the top revenue earning movies and what is the impact of Director, Actor, Votes, Metascore and Runtime on the Revenue.  We will also see which genres create significant impact at the Box office.

Do "Genres" really play an important role in determining the success of a movie?
